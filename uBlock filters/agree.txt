! Title: papo filters â€“ hide agree popup and backdrop shade filter
! Description: Hides message boxes poping up on page open, like to agree to use cookies. Also removes backdrop.
!              This might break a page, if page's code is updated.
!              e.g. JS can remove scroll bars and when user does not click OK page can't be scrolled.
!              As I also use JS blocker for some JS code, I might not know if this happens for a page when I create a filter here.
