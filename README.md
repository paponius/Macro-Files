# Macro Files    
Macro, or data files for various scripts, programs and plugins.  
Which can be updated online.

These files are sourced directly from this repository using:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paponius/Macro-Files/master/uBlock%20filters/<FILENAME>  
or
https://github.com/paponius/Macro-Files/raw/master/uBlock%20filters/<FILENAME>  

They both work and I don't know the difference between them.  
I think the first is older and now the second is used, while the first still works.

  
! Title: papo filters – unsorted. all sorts and countries.    
! Description: List started on my "My filters" tab. Now I have many browsers and I want  
!              to keep them updated without need to use manual cloud sync.  
!              Also to be able to add my list to friend's browser.  
!              This unsorted list is maybe not suitable for generic public,  
!              as it might break some functionality which I don't use on purpose.  
!              I will slowly, maybe years, move parts from this file to separate  
!              filter files based on a type and country.

! Title: papo filters – Changing certain behaviour I found wrong  
! Description: One of thin  
!              This filter file might also remove some functionality on purpose,  
!              which I don't use and find annoying. (pop-over menus, overlay buttons)  
!              Such buttons are hidden, which might disallow use.
